# SKILLS CHALLENGE: Mission Start - Space Algorithm Challenge!

Prepare your propulsion units, activate your navigation systems, and adjust your coordinates for a new adventure! Welcome to the Skills Challenge edition "Algorithmic Space Challenge: Journey to the Lost Planet"!

Our challenge this year is officially launched and will test your skills in logic, front-end programming, and back-end programming, all set in the vastness of space. What could go wrong in an intergalactic mission, right?

# Main Challenge:

You are tasked with programming the navigation algorithm that will control our spaceship en route to the Lost Planet. Using a space map represented by a matrix of characters, your task is to find the shortest path to the destination while avoiding treacherous asteroids and dense nebulas.

Additionally, to complement the challenge, we have launched an interface visual challenge: create an attractive and functional visualization of the space journey, representing the space, the rocket, the planet, and the asteroids in an intuitive way.
